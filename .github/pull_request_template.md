# Submitter Checklist

These are the criteria that every PR should meet, please check them off as you
review them:

- [ ] Includes [tests](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/standards.md#principles) (if functionality changed/added)
- [ ] Includes [docs](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/standards.md#principles) (if user facing)
- [ ] Commit messages follow [commit message best practices](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/standards.md#commit-messages)
- [ ] Release notes block has been filled in or deleted (only if no user facing changes)

_See [the contribution guide](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details._

Double check this list of stuff that's easy to miss:

- If you are adding [a new binary/image to the `cmd` dir](../cmd), please update
  [the release Task](../tekton/publish.yaml) to build and release this image.

## Reviewer Notes

If [API changes](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/api_compatibility_policy.md) are included, [additive changes](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/api_compatibility_policy.md#additive-changes) must be approved by at least two [OWNERS](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/OWNERS) and [backwards incompatible changes](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/api_compatibility_policy.md#backwards-incompatible-changes) must be approved by [more than 50% of the OWNERS](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/OWNERS), and they must first be added [in a backwards compatible way](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/api_compatibility_policy.md#backwards-compatible-changes-first).

# Release Notes

<!--
Describe any user facing changes here, or delete this block.

Examples of user facing changes:
- API changes
- Bug fixes
- Any changes in behavior
- Changes requiring upgrade notices or deprecation warnings

For pull requests with a release note:

    ```release-note
    Your release note here
    ```

For pull requests that require additional action from users switching to the new release, include the string "action required" (case insensitive) in the release note:

    ```release-note
    action required: your release note here
    ```

For pull requests that don't need to be mentioned at release time, use the `/release-note-none` Prow command to add the `release-note-none` label to the PR. You can also write the string "NONE" as a release note in your PR description:

    ```release-note
    NONE
    ```
